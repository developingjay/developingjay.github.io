## What is the JAMstack

![jamstackbreakdown.jpg](jamstackbreakdown.jpg)

The JAMstack is a cloud-native web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript code, reusable APIs, and markup content. It was pioneered and created by Netlify. In its purest form, the idea of JAMstack is that a web application is pre-built into static pages, using content and code to generate the output. In basic terms, JAMstack is a significant shift in focus from the now abstractable back end to the now-powerful front end.

JAMstack can create better performance, higher security, easier scaling and better developer experiences.

## What is not JAMstack

Any application that relys on the front-end (client) and back-end (server) is not built with JAMstack.

### CMS server side CMS including
- Wordpress
- Drupal
- Joomlaa
- Squarespace

### Server-run web apps including
- Ruby
- Node
- Python 
- .Net Core

### SPA that uses isomorphic rendering including
- React
- Vue
- Angular

## Why the JAMstack

### Better Performance
Why wait for pages to build on the fly when you can generate them at deploy time? When it comes to minimizing the time to first byte, nothing beats pre-built files served over a CDN.

### Higher Security
With server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs, surface areas for attacks are reduced. You can also leverage the domain expertise of specialist third-party services.

### Better Developer Experience
Loose coupling and separation of controls allow for more targeted development and debugging, and the expanding selection of CMS options for site generators remove the need to maintain a separate stack for content and marketing.

### Cheaper, Easier Scaling
When your deployment amounts to a stack of files that can be served anywhere, scaling is a matter of serving those files in more places. CDNs are perfect for this, and often include scaling in all of their plans.
